prompt0 (ðŸ”Š "prompt zero") is a free and open-source prompt management tool. Itâ€™s designed to streamline the entire prompt lifecycle â€” from ideation and writing to evaluation, deployment, and analytics. prompt0 offers an efficient and centralized platform to manage prompts across various LLM providers (including OpenAI, Anthropic, and more).

## Where prompt0 is Used?

## Features

- **Multi-provider support**: Manage and optimize prompts across 100+ LLM providers using one platform.

Pricing for the managed version is undecided, but it will remain affordable to cover infrastructure costs.
